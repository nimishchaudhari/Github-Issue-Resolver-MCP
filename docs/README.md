# Documentation

This directory contains all documentation for the GitHub Issue Resolver MCP project.

## Knowledge Base

The [KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md](./KNOWLEDGE_BASE.md) file serves as a comprehensive record of all changes, decisions, and actions taken during development. Unlike the project's CHANGELOG.md which focuses on version releases, the Knowledge Base tracks:

- Detailed development activities
- Technical decisions and their rationales
- Alternative approaches considered
- Learning insights
- Development challenges and solutions
- Future work planning

## Knowledge Base Maintenance Guidelines

To maintain the Knowledge Base effectively:

1. **Record all significant activities:**
   - Code changes that affect the project architecture
   - Technical decisions with their rationales
   - Alternative approaches considered
   - Development challenges encountered and their solutions

2. **Use the following structure for entries:**
   ```markdown
   ### YYYY-MM-DD
   
   #### [Activity Category]
   - **Action**: [Description of what was done]
     - **Rationale**: [Why this approach was chosen]
     - **Details**: [Specific implementation notes]
   ```

3. **Categories to use:**
   - Repository Changes
   - Code Implementation
   - Technical Decisions
   - Infrastructure Changes
   - Documentation Updates
   - Issue Resolution
   - Feature Development

4. **Update frequency:**
   - Update the Knowledge Base with every significant commit
   - For major changes, add detailed descriptions immediately
   - Review and consolidate the Knowledge Base weekly

5. **Reference related issues and PRs:**
   - Include links to GitHub issues, PRs, or commits when relevant
   - Example: `Related to PR #42, Resolves Issue #21`

The Knowledge Base serves as the institutional memory of the project, helping new contributors understand the history and context of development decisions.
