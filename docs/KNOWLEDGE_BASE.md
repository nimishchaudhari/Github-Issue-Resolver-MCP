## Technical Decisions

### Environment Setup (2025-03-19)
- **Decision**: Use Ubuntu as the base image for development
  - **Rationale**: Ubuntu provides a stable and widely-used environment with good package support
  - **Alternatives Considered**: Alpine (rejected due to potential compatibility issues with some dependencies)
- **Decision**: Include both Node.js and Python in the development environment
  - **Rationale**: Project may require both languages for different components
  - **Implementation**: Added both to Dockerfile

## Future Work Tracking
